<https://www.doctro.com/resource/covid_19> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID‑19 transmits when infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. The risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. People remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms."@en .

Most people will experience symptoms between 2 and 7 days after being infected with covid. Almost all symptomatic people will experience at least one symptom within 12-days of being infected."@en .
<https://www.doctro.com/resource/covid_19> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/longCovidDescription>  "Long COVID or long-haul COVID is a series of health problems persisting or developing after an initial COVID-19 infection. Symptoms can last weeks, months or years and are often debilitating. The World Health Organization defines long COVID as starting three months after infection, but other definitions put the start of long COVID at four weeks. Long COVID is characterised by a large number of symptoms, which sometimes disappear and reappear. Commonly reported symptoms of long COVID are fatigue, memory problems, shortness of breath, and sleep disorder.Many other symptoms can also be present, including headaches, loss of smell or taste, muscle weakness, fever, and cognitive dysfunction and problems with mental health. Symptoms often get worse after mental or physical effort, a process called post-exertional malaise. There is a large overlap in symptoms with ME/CFS."@en .

This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction."@en .
