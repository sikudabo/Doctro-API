# Welcome
This is the API for the Doctro application. This application utilizes natural language processing and semantics with the resource description framework ```(RDF)``` to enable conversational chatting with patients regarding Covid-19. There is a corresponding native client application for iOS and Android devices in the ```Doctro-Native``` repo that can enable end-to-end functionality from asking a question to receiving an answer for covid-related questions. The answers given by Doctro should not replace advice from a medical professional. If you believe you have Covid-19, please seek assistance from a medical professional. Doctro is a tool that can simply enable you to gain more insights and information about your condition. 

## Video Demo
This video demonstrates the front-end client interacting with this API end-to-end.
